		The Healthcare industry faces many challenges, like an operational crisis, omnipresent bureaucracy, and obsolete managerial practices. These challenges have increased healthcare services’ cost and decreased the employees’ efficiency, making the working environment unproductive. To effectively run a hospital, not only an expert team is needed, but there is also a demand for highly optimized and systematic management. A good Hospital Management System (HMS) can be a perfect solution, that will help overcome the challenges, assist the doctors, help the staff manage the documents quickly, and perform less mundane tasks with more efficiency.

		Like every other industry, a Hospital needs a proper management system to coordinate their employees, communicate with doctors, and assign duties and responsibilities among the staff. A hospital's personnel deals with patients’ data. The nature of the data is very sensitive, and even a small glitch can cause a breach costing a large sum of money, they’ve been known to rack up sums to a million dollars.

	<p>
		One of the biggest reasons for having a safe and highly advanced HMS is clients’ data security. The best solution that can be found in this situation is implementing a hospital management system (HMS).A Hospital Management System (HMS) is a web or cloud-based software that integrates data from all departments and automates the hospital process.
	</p>
	<br/>
	<p>
		An HMS helps automate the routine management process and collect and store all the required information to run a hospital. The System is used to collect data from the patients and store it. It is also used to access data from suppliers, contractors, sub-contractors, doctors, staff members, and other associated personnel that needs to be managed

			<p>Going to the hospital can be stressful. Patients and their loved ones might be worried about an illness, anxious about recovery times, or concerned about what a procedure will cost. Today more than ever, patients have a great number of choices to make about the type of medical care they receive. We know that patients need to have reliable and understandable information about the level of care our hospital provides in order to make the best decisions possible.
			</p>

			<p> 
			Patients and families know quality care when they experience it. A nurse's response time, a doctor's bedside manner, the hospital's atmosphere—all of these things affect how people feel about the quality of their healthcare.
            When hospitals talk about quality, it is generally in reference to very specific clinical data collected and analyzed over a period of time. Quality measurement isn't always easy. Different agencies and groups have different ways of reporting clinical outcomes that can affect the way they rate a hospital on a certain quality measure
			</p>
		    <br/> 
			<p>
				Safe: Avoiding injuries to patients from the care that is intended to help them.
            <br/>
                Effective: Providing services based on scientific knowledge and best practice.
            <br/>
                Patient-centered: Providing care is respectful of and responsive to individual patient preferences, needs and values, ensuring that patients' values guide all clinical decisions.
